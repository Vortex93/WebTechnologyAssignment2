            <h1>Twenty One Pilots</h1>
            <p>Twenty One Pilots (stylized as twenty one pilots or TWENTY ØNE PILØTS, and sometimes abbreviated as TØP)
                is an American musical duo originating from Columbus, Ohio. The band was formed in 2009 by Tyler Joseph
                along with former members Nick Thomas and Chris Salih, who eventually left in 2011, and currently
                consists of lead vocalist and keyboardist Tyler Joseph and drummer Josh Dun. The duo rose to fame in
                the mid–2010s, after several years of touring and independent releases.</p>
            <p>They put out two self-released albums, Twenty One Pilots in 2009 and Regional at Best in 2011, before
                being signed by Fueled by Ramen in 2012. Their label debut, Vessel, was released in 2013.[15]
                The duo achieved breakthrough success with their fourth album, Blurryface (2015), which produced two
                worldwide hit singles — "Stressed Out" and "Ride". In addition, the single "Heathens", recorded for the
                soundtrack of the film Suicide Squad, was also successful. Its success made the group the first
                alternative artist to have two concurrent top ten singles in the US.</p>

            <h1>History</h1>
            <p>The band was formed in 2009 in Columbus, Ohio by college friends Tyler Joseph, Nick Thomas and Chris
                Salih. Tyler came up with the band's name while studying All My Sons by Arthur Miller, a play
                about a man who must decide what is best for his family after causing the death of twenty-one pilots
                during World War II because he knowingly sent them faulty parts for the good of his business. Tyler
                explains that this story of moral dilemma was the inspiration for the name of the band. On
                December 29, 2009, they released their debut, self-titled album, Twenty One Pilots, and began touring
                Ohio.</p>
            <p>In 2011, Thomas and Salih sequentially left due to busy schedules, both posting farewell notes on the
                band's official Facebook page. Joseph was then joined by Josh Dun, former live drummer of House
                of Heroes.</p>
            <p>Their second self-release, Regional at Best, was released July 8, 2011 with the new lineup consisting of
                only Joseph and Dun. The album was accompanied by a free CD release show on the grounds of New Albany
                High School. In November 2011, they played a sold out show at Columbus' Newport Music Hall attracting
                the attention of a dozen record labels. Although many labels fought over the band, it was ultimately
                decided that they would sign to the Atlantic Records subsidiary label Fueled by Ramen.</p>
            <p>In April 2012, at a sold out show at the Lifestyle Communities Pavilion, they announced their signing to
                Atlantic Records subsidiary label Fueled by Ramen. On July 17, 2012, they released their debut
                Fueled by Ramen recording in the form of a three song EP, entitled Three Songs. In August 2012, they
                embarked on a short tour with Neon Trees and Walk the Moon. They worked with Greg Wells, producer of
                Adele and Katy Perry, on their first full-length album on the record label Fueled by Ramen, Vessel.
                It was released January 8, 2013 and reached No. 21 on the Billboard 200, No. 9 on the Digital Albums
                chart, No. 17 on the Internet Albums chart, No. 15 on the Rock Albums Chart and No. 10 on the
                Alternative Albums Chart.</p>
            <p>On March 16, 2015, the band announced that Blurryface was to be released on May 19. They also
                released the first single, called "Fairly Local". Their second single of the album, "Tear in My
                Heart", and its music video were released on April 5, 2015. On April 28, "Stressed Out", the third
                single from the album, was released along with a music video. "Stressed Out" peaked at number
                two on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100, and number one on both Alternative Songs and Hot Rock Songs.</p>
